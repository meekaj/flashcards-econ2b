# Macroeconomics FlashCards

## Overview
This FlashCard application is a personalised Java program I developed based on my notes from the second-semester Macroeconomics course during my second year at university. The application is designed to aid in studying and reviewing key economic concepts through an interactive question-and-answer format. 


## How to Use
1. **Start the Program**: Execute the `FlashCardApp` class to begin a study session.
2. **Respond to FlashCards**: Enter your answers into the console after each question prompt and press Enter.
3. **Review Feedback**: Check whether your answers are correct and read the feedback to better understand each topic.
4. **Complete the Deck**: Work through the entire set of flashcards to ensure comprehensive review coverage.
